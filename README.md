# Flappybird clone

In this game you play as a bird, your mission is to avoid crashing into the ground or the pipes. The bird (you) is of course pulled down by gravity, you can fight the gravity by flapping your wings (using SPACE). For every pipe that you manage to fly through, you will be rewarded with one point! Fly safe and enjoy!
